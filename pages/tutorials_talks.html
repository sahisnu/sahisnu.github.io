                      Dialogue systems, also known as chatbots, have gained escalating popularity in recent times due to their
                      wide-spread applications in carrying out chit-chat conversations with users and accomplishing various tasks
                      as personal assistants. However, they still have some major limitations. One key limitation is that they are
                      typically trained from pre-collected and manually-labeled data and/or written with handcrafted rules. Their
                      knowledge bases (KBs) are pre-compiled by human experts and are fixed after deployment. Due to the huge amount
                      of manual effort involved, they are difficult to scale and also tend to produce many errors ought to their
                      limited ability to understand natural language and the limited knowledge in their KBs. Thus, when these systems
                      are deployed, the level of user satisfaction is often low.
                      <br/>
                      <br/>

                      In this tutorial, we introduce and discuss the research to give chatbots the ability to continuously and
                      interactively learn new knowledge during conversation, i.e., learning on-the-job after deployment by themselves
                      so that as the systems chat more and more with end-users, they become more and more knowledgeable and improve
                      their performance over time. The first part of the tutorial focuses on introducing the paradigm of lifelong
                      and continual learning and discuss various related problems and challenges in conversational AI applications.
                      The second part presents the recent advancements in continual learning after model deployment, with a focus on
                      continuous lexical and factual knowledge learning during chatting and learning to ground new language expressions
                      via interactions with end-users. Finally, we conclude with a discussion on the scope for continual conversational
                      skill learning and present some open challenges.

                    Large amount of location-aware reviews are accumulating on the web in recent years due to the
                    escalating popularity of Location-based Social Networking platforms like Yelp, Foursquare, Brightkite
                    etc among users. By analyzing the location-aware review data, we can discover various location-specific
                    knowledge and develop myriads of location-aware recommendation applications. But, processing of the large-scale
                    review data using NLP techniques is not an easy task as it requires longer time in the knowledge discovery process.
                    We can leverage big data analytics platforms like Hadoop and the concept of Map-reduce programming to process
                    these data in real-time.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this tutorial, we primarily discuss about the potentiality of location-aware reviews
                    in inferring specific information about a location and how location-aware review analytics can lead us to
                    the successful development of wide-range of useful recommendation applications. We present a brief introduction
                    of NLP techniques, Apache Hadoop and Map-reduce programming for the analysis of location-aware reviews on big
                    data environment. We present a case study ActMiner and LANet for discovering location-specific activities from
                    location-aware reviews and harvesting the Knowledge base. And then, we show how the system can be extended to
                    process massive review dataset in Map-reduce environment. We also show how we can leverage the knowledge of
                    locations and its supported activities for building a location-aware activity recommendation system. Finally, we
                    conclude our discussion by addressing the usefulness of the system in real-life scenario.
