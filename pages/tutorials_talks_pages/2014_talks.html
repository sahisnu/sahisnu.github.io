                    Large amount of location-aware reviews are accumulating on the web in recent years due to the
                    escalating popularity of Location-based Social Networking platforms like Yelp, Foursquare, Brightkite
                    etc among users. By analyzing the location-aware review data, we can discover various location-specific
                    knowledge and develop myriads of location-aware recommendation applications. But, processing of the large-scale
                    review data using NLP techniques is not an easy task as it requires longer time in the knowledge discovery process.
                    We can leverage big data analytics platforms like Hadoop and the concept of Map-reduce programming to process
                    these data in real-time.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this tutorial, we primarily discuss about the potentiality of location-aware reviews
                    in inferring specific information about a location and how location-aware review analytics can lead us to
                    the successful development of wide-range of useful recommendation applications. We present a brief introduction
                    of NLP techniques, Apache Hadoop and Map-reduce programming for the analysis of location-aware reviews on big
                    data environment. We present a case study ActMiner and LANet for discovering location-specific activities from
                    location-aware reviews and harvesting the Knowledge base. And then, we show how the system can be extended to
                    process massive review dataset in Map-reduce environment. We also show how we can leverage the knowledge of
                    locations and its supported activities for building a location-aware activity recommendation system. Finally, we
                    conclude our discussion by addressing the usefulness of the system in real-life scenario.
