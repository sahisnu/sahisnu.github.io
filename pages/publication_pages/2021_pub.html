                      This paper proposes to study a fine-grained semantic novelty detection task, which can be illustrated with
                      the following example. It is normal that a person walks a dog in the park, but if someone says “A man is walking
                      a chicken in the park,” it is novel. Given a set of natural language descriptions of normal scenes, we want to
                      identify descriptions of novel scenes. We are not aware of any existing work that solves the problem. Although
                      existing novelty or anomaly detection algorithms are applicable, since they are usually topic-based, they perform
                      poorly on our fine-grained semantic novelty detection task. This paper proposes an effective model (called GAT-MA)
                      to solve the problem and also contributes a new dataset. Experimental evaluation shows that GAT-MA outperforms 11
                      baselines by large margins.

                      Dialogue systems, also called chatbots, are now used in a wide range of applications. However, they still have some
                      major weaknesses. One key weakness is that they are typically trained from manually-labeled data and/or written with
                      handcrafted rules, and their knowledge bases (KBs) are also compiled by human experts. Due to the huge amount of manual
                      effort involved, they are difficult to scale and also tend to produce many errors ought to their limited ability to
                      understand natural language and the limited knowledge in their KBs. Thus, the level of user satisfactory is often low.
                      In this paper, we propose to dramatically improve the situation by endowing the chatbots the ability to continually learn
                      (1) new world knowledge, (2) new language expressions to ground them to actions, and (3) new conversational skills,
                      during conversation by themselves so that as they chat more and more with users, they become more and more knowledgeable
                      and are better and better able to understand diverse natural language expressions and to improve their conversational skills.

                      AI assistants can now carry out tasks for users by directly interacting with website UIs. Current semantic parsing
                      and slot-filling techniques cannot flexibly adapt to many different websites without being constantly re-trained.
                      We propose FLIN, a natural language interface for web navigation that maps user commands to concept-level actions
                      (rather than low-level UI actions), thus being able to flexibly adapt to different websites and handle their
                      transient nature. We frame this as a ranking problem: given a user command and a webpage, FLIN learns to score the
                      most relevant navigation instruction (involving action and parameter values). To train and evaluate FLIN, we collect
                      a dataset using nine popular websites from three domains. Our results show that FLIN was able to adapt to new
                      websites in a given domain.
