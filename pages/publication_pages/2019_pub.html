                    Dialogue systems are increasingly using knowledge bases (KBs) storing real-world facts to help
                    generate quality responses. However, as the KBs are inherently incomplete and remain fixed during
                    conversation, it limits dialogue systems' ability to answer questions and to handle questions involving
                    entities or relations that are not in the KB. In this paper, we make an attempt to propose an engine for
                    Continuous and Interactive Learning of Knowledge (CILK) for dialogue systems to give them the ability
                    to continuously and interactively learn and infer new knowledge during conversations. With more knowledge
                    accumulated over time, they will be able to learn better and answer more questions. Our empirical evaluation
                    shows that CILK is promising.
